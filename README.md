* [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) - The NoSQL Database
* [Express](https://expressjs.com/) - Node Framework
* [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/) - The Server

## Client
* [Angular](https://angular.io/)
* [Angular Material](https://material.angular.io/)

### Installing

Clone the project to your local machine.

Make a .env file in the server root directory.

Open the `server` and `room-booking` folders in Terminal windows.

Run ```npm i``` to install npm dependencies in each window.

Once the npm dependencies have installed, in the server terminal window enter `nodemon server.js` and navigate to `http://localhost:3000/`.

In the client terminal, cd into the `room-booking` folder and run `ng serve` and navigate to `http://localhost:4200`.
